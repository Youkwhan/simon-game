# Simon Game

This is an interactive Simon Game written in JavaScript/jQuery/CSS/HTML to simulate the classic Simon Electronic Memory Game.
Get ready to watch, remember, repeat!
## Game Rule

Players need to repeat random sequences of blinking lights by pressing colored pads in the correct order. To progress to higher levels, they must remember the previous sequence, which gets longer with each successful attempt. If all buttons are clicked correctly, they will proceed to the next level.

## Usage

To play the game, simply visit the [live demo](insert_link_here) of the game in your browser.

## Installation

To run the game on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy the game!

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add keyboard functionality to the game, so that players can use the keyboard instead of clicking on the buttons. 
A scoreboard, to keep track of your highscore. And a button hint "Show Full Patten (3 Left)" that will help the player to progress to even farther heights!
